            <h3>What does Agile mean?</h3>
            <p>
                Agile means different things to different people in the software industry. Here is what it means to us:
                Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation,
                customer collaboration over contract negotiation and responding to change over following a plan. We
                certainly didn't make these principles up on our own though as they are directly from the Agile Manifesto.

                At Agile Orbit, we leverage some of the best languages, libraries and frameworks available today for
                our projects. Whenever possible we leverage open-source technology which helps us achieve cost
                reduction, flexibility, better performance and reliability. It also avoids vendor lock-in for our
                clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the primary technologies we use, but if you are currently using something else, please still
                feel free to contact us regarding your project. We are certainly open to using other technologies that
                are outside our current architectural patterns if it makes sense for a project.

            <p>
                We leverage the Java Virtual Machine for most of our web development and service-based projects as it
                is the most performant runtime in the industry with a tremendous amount of reusable open-source
                libraries readily available. Our specialties are the Java and Groovy programming languages with the
                Grails framework.

                We leverage both hybrid and native technologies for our mobile development projects as different
                projects have different requirements. We can help you form a mobile development strategy that balances
                reusability, functionality and performance. Our specialities are the Apple iOS and Google Android
                platforms for native development and PhoneGap for hybrid development.

                actual application development process.
